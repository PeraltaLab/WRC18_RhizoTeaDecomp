"Experimental nutrient enrichment increases bacterial diversity and decomposition rates of different litter types in a coastal plain wetland" This study was conducted at the long-term fertilization and mowing experiment at West Research Campus, East Carolina University.

For information regarding the project, please visit: [update with publication information]

## We address the following questions

* **Aim 1.)**: How does long-term fertilization and disturbance (by mowing) and litter quality influence litter-associated microbiomes and decomposition rates?

* **Aim 2.)**: What are the specific bacterial taxa associated with decomposition of high vs. low C:N ratio litter types?
